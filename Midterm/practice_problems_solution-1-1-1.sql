-- 1.	Consider the following Pure SQL query:

SELECT DISTINCT w1.cname
FROM works w1, works w2
WHERE w1.cname = w2.cname AND w1.pid <> w2.pid

-- Formulate an equivalent query in Pure SQL that does not use the DISTINCT clause.

SELECT r.A

--3. Consider the following constraint: Each manager must have all the skills of each of the employees that he or she manages. Write a Pure SQL boolean query that returns true if this constraint is satisfied in the database, and returns false if this is not the case.

select not exists (select m.mid

--7. Formulate the following query in Pure SQL (in particular, you cannot use SQL aggregate functions in your solution):

--Find each pairs (c,e) where c is the name of a company and e is the pid of an employee who works for that company and who has at least one manager who lacks at least one of that employee’s job skills.

select w.cname as c, w.pid as e
